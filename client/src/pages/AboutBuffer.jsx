              How Our Buffer System Works
            </h1>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
              Our crowdfunding platform features a unique buffer system designed to provide additional security and flexibility for both entrepreneurs and investors. This system ensures that projects can continue to receive support even after their initial funding goals are met, while also protecting investors&apos; interests.

            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
              The buffer system allows campaigns to receive additional investments beyond their initial funding goals. Here&apos;s how it works:
            </p>
            <ul className="mt-4 list-decimal list-inside text-gray-600">
              <li>
                <strong>Initial Funding Goal:</strong> When a campaign reaches its initial funding goal, it remains open for additional investments. This ensures that promising projects can continue to receive support from investors who see their potential.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Additional Investments:</strong> Investors who contribute beyond the initial goal receive additional equity or rewards, incentivizing further investment. This buffer amount acts as an extra layer of financial support for the project.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Utilization of Buffer Funds:</strong> If the project needs to utilize the buffer funds, the additional equity or rewards promised to these investors are honored. This ensures that investors are fairly compensated for their continued support.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Refund Option:</strong> If the buffer funds are not needed or utilized, investors have the option to request a refund of their additional contributions. This flexibility helps maintain investor confidence and trust in the platform.
              </li>

            <ul className="mt-4 list-disc list-inside text-gray-600">
              <li>Provides extra financial support for projects beyond the initial goal.</li>

              <li>Offers a safety net for projects to continue thriving even if unexpected costs arise.</li>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Example Scenario</h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
              Suppose a startup sets an initial funding goal of $100,000. Once this goal is met, the campaign remains open for additional investments. If investors contribute an extra $20,000, these funds are held in the buffer. If the startup needs to use this buffer amount, the investors who contributed will receive additional equity. If the buffer is not used, these investors can choose to get their $20,000 back, ensuring their investments are protected.
